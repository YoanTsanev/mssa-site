        <h4>Project objective:</h4>
        <p>Conducting fundamental scientific research by young scientists and students in the field of technical sciences, informatics, mathematics and medical sciences to acquire new knowledge about fundamental processes and phenomena and dependencies in these fields. 
            The main goals are the creation of models, tools for the analysis of physiological data, software modules for their processing and cataloging.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>Project tasks:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Survey of our and global biomedical data modeling research experience;</li>
            <li>Study of different types of sensors for recording biomedical signals;</li>
            <li>Creation of models and algorithms for biomedical signal processing;</li>
            <li>Creating a prototype of a sensor system for research and analysis of the body's health;</li>
            <li>Creation of algorithms for analysis and decision-making based on information about the health status of the organism;</li>
            <li>Promotion of received information and results.</li>
        </ol>        
        <br>

        <h4>Expected results</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accumulation of new knowledge regarding the modeling of the specific biomedical signals (electrocardiographic and photoplethysmographic).
            </li>
            <li>
                Creation, testing and research of new algorithms for biomedical signal processing and analysis.
                <ul>
                    
                    We expect the created sensor system:
                        <ul>
                            <li>to support the effective research and analysis of the body's health status by offering new means of establishing and specifying the body's health problems;</li>
                            <li>to enable the analysis of risk conditions in cardiac activity and the prediction of high-risk life-threatening upcoming events.</li>
                        </ul>
                   
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Improvement of qualification, development of competence for working with biomedical data and teamwork skills, the accumulation of experience by the scientific team.
